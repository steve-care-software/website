            <p>We are building a decentralized platform where people can script legal contracts, keep track of their execution, buy, sell or transfer them to anyone they wish and/or execute them using the legal framework they were written under.</p>
            <p>We will soon release our alpha version.  If you'd like to be among the first to try our technology, please <a href="mailto:info@steve.care">email us</a>.</p>
